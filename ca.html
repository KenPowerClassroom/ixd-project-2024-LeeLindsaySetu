        <td class="Question"><b>Engagement:</b> How engaging is the app? Is it visually appealing? Does it have sound and animation to 
            capture the user's attention? Does it have a good balance of challenge and reward?</td>
        <td id="good">Kahoot utilizes gamification to its fullest extent, by incorporating many distinct aspects of games 
                into the app. Some of these features include a scoreboard that tracks the points of the users who 
                get the highest score, and each user gets a higher multiplier to their points if they continue to
                get answers right and go on a “streak” this encourages the user to perform better to get a higher 
                place on the score board. Kahoot offers many different customization options when creating quizzes 
                to keep engagement high (10/10) </td>
        <td id="good">Gamification plays a significant role in code combat as it teaches the user how to code by going
                through “levels”, each level having its own animations and outcomes depending on what the user 
                inputs. This engages the user by creating an environment similar that to an RPG which can be highly
                 engaging and encourage young users to continue learning (8/10) </td>
        <td id="good">Teams feedback is useful to the user as it shows the user all their new assignments and messages 
                right from the home page. From the assignments tab the user is able to view upcomig,past and 
                completed assignments. The assignments tab makes it super simple for the user to track all their 
                work and even receive feedback on their work (9/10) </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td >Progress tracking: How well does the app track the user's progress? Does it provide feedback and 
                recommendations to help users improve their performance? Does it use data to personalize the
                learning experience?</td>
            <td id="good">Kahoot tracks its progress of the user regularly as the quiz progress by showing the user how well 
                they performed after each question and showing them all parts of their performance such as, if they 
                got the answer right or wrong, what the correct answer was and also rewards them a certain amount of 
                points based on quickly they answered the question (8/10)</td>
            <td id="good">Progress in code combat is tracked by the amount of work the user puts into by completing the many 
                “levels” the app offers to help teach a variety of codes. The progress that the user makes grants 
                them access to more complex experiences based on the number of “levels” they have completed. The user
                 can also purchase equipment using a currency gained by completing levels. This is a very gratifying 
                 experience for the user that rewards the amount of time they invest into their learning experience.

                <td>User experience: How user-friendly is the app? Is it easy to navigate and use? Does it have 
                    clear instructions and prompts? Does it have a well-designed interface?</td>
                <td id="okay">Kahoot's opening page can be quite overwhelming at first especially its constant pushing of 
                    upgrading to a membership option, this can make it quite difficult for the user to find the quiz
                    they would like to take, especially if it's their first time using the app. Once the user is 
                    engaged in a quiz the user experience becomes a lot easier to handle as they use simple and 
                    easy to understand color options when choosing your answer. (5/10) </td>
                <td id="good">Code combat is super simple for the user to navigate, using large and easy to read text to help
                    the user better understand the next step in their learning experience. Even when clicking on a 
                    stage of levels the UI will direct the user to the furthest level they are in with a giant 
                    animated arrow which makes it easy for the user to keep track of where they are (9/10) </td>
                <td id="good">Teams interface can be super simple and easy to navigate depending on who creates the team, a 
                    good team can be navigated with ease, with all the information they need only being one or two 
                    mouse clicks away. On the other hand, a bad team can ruin the users experience by having them 
                    constantly back pedaling through the tabs to find what they're looking for (7/10)
